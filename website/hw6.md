# Homework 6 - Epidemic modeling III

Homeworks are in the form of [Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). If you are an MIT student, you must complete them and submit them on [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/5637) . If you are not an MIT student, we encourage you to [join discord](https://discord.gg/Z5qnVf8) and find someone to cross-grade.
