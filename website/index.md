# Introduction to Computational Thinking

Welcome to **MIT 18.S191 aka 6.S083 aka 22.S092**, **Fall 2020** edition!

\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

Topics include:

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Epidemic propagation
- Climate modeling


The course has now concluded, but you can still take it at your own pace from this website! Feel free to hang out in the course [discord server](https://discord.gg/Z5qnVf8) and ask questions!
